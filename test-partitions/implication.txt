This is a partitioning of possible load/store checks that tries to show
possible complications about removing checks where a check can be removed
because its failure is implied by another.

1. index problem 
1.1. none
1.2. off in the same direction
1.3. off in different directions

2. allocation problem
2.1. none
2.2. first check on a possibly freed object
2.3. last check on a possibly freed object
2.4. both checks on a possibly freed object

3. boundary expression type
3.1. constant
3.2. simple expression (which limitations apply?)
3.3. unknown
3.4. anything else

4. number of memory object sets
4.1. one
4.2. two

5. CFG structure
5.1. same basic block
5.2. single connecting path
5.3. multiple connecting paths

6. loop structure
6.1. none
6.2. checks in the same loop
6.3. checks in different loops / one not in a loop
